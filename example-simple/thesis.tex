% These packages are not mandatory but they are generally recommended.
% The package graphicx is the common package used to include images in
% the document, usually as a part of a figure:
\usepackage{graphicx}
% The package hyperref is needed to easily navigate through the thesis
% PDF file by making citations clickable, elements of the table of
% contents, URLs, etc.  Including it just by default like this:
%\usepackage{hyperref}
% creates red-bordered boxes around clickable items, which although
% helpful to notice clickable areas do not look nice.  A way to hide
% those boxes, but change colour of clickable text is as follows:
\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
\hypersetup{
  colorlinks=true,
  linkcolor=blue,
  citecolor=black,
  filecolor=magenta,
  urlcolor=blue, }

Get it done!  Use reference material by Lamport~\cite{latex-by-lamport} or

\chapter{Doing It}

\section{Getting Ready}

Get all the parts that I need.  I can throw in a whole pile of terms like
preparation,
methodology,
forethought,
and
analysis
as examples for me to use in the future.

\section{Next Step}

Do it!

Of course, you have to have pictures to show how you did it to make people
understand things better.

\chapter{Conclusion}

Did it!
