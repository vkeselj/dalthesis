\begin{abstract}
This part contains abstract of the thesis or similar report.
The abstract should capture a short summary of the whole paper.
Write the abstract having in mind that at some point someone may only
be able to access the title, author name, and abstract of the thesis,
and they should have enough information to have an idea about the
whole work.  Do not include citations in the abstract since they
require a look-up in the references list.

\chapter{Introduction}

Get it done!  Use reference material by Lamport~\cite{latex-by-lamport} or
Gooses, Mittelback, and Samarin~\cite{latex-companion}.

To test if the margins are satisfactory, let us generate a lot of
garbage text:

\chapter{Background and Related Work}

\section{Getting Ready}

Get all the parts that I need.  I can throw in a whole pile of terms like
preparation,
methodology,
forethought,
and
analysis
as examples for me to use in the future.

\section{Next Step}

Do it!

Of course, you have to have pictures to show how you did it to make people
understand things better.

Consider difference between these two formulas, the first one is incorrect:
\[ z-score = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \]
and this is the proper way to format the \textit{z-score} variable:
\[ \textit{z-score} = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \]



\chapter{Methodology}

In a typical thesis structure, somewhere around the third chapter, we
could have a methodology description.  We will fill some text now.
A common practice to fill text in a sample document is the so-called
``Lorem ipsum'' text, which consists of randomly generated Latin text
as follows.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad
minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in
reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla
pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in
culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
